# User-Centered Design
### An intro by James Gordon, RJI Student Competition Mentor

???
- I want to start by talking about innovation.
- How we create new things and seize emerging opportunities.

# What we *think* innovation looks like

.center[![Innovation as linear](linear-innovation.svg)]

???
- We often think of design as a linear process
- We have honest and earnest good intentions.
    - We want to "make the world a better place", to use the familiar trope of silicon valley tech pitches.
- Then, by combining those good intentions with our innate cleverness, we come up with a great idea.
- And often we come up upon these good ideas around the time that we stumble upon some hot new technology that we think will make our idea possible.
- Then we put all our efforts into barrelling ahead, trying to move our idea past any obstacle in our path.
- And we do everything to protect our idea along the way.
- Until we reach our goal and allow ourselves to rest and bask in the glory of our accomplishment.
- In this mental model of innovation, there are only two possible directions:
    - You either moving forward toward you dream, toward making that picture you have in your head a reality.
    - Or you're falling behind
    - And you don't really have to reflect much on the choices you're making, so long as they seem to move you forward.
- In my early days as a product manager at a tech company, I definitely fell hard into this way of thinking.
    - And I've often wondered why did this perspective of innovation feel true.
    - I think it has something to do with the stereotype of The Innovator and the mythologies that surround that persona.
    - We tend to believe that innovation requires some sort prophetic vision and unyielding will.
- Here are couple of examples of the mythology I'm talking about.

# What we *think* innovators look like

> "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses."

.quote-attribution[Henry Ford ([but not really](<https://hbr.org/2011/08/henry-ford-never-said-the-fast>))]

???
- This quote from Henry Ford, a founding father of the American automobile industry, is often trotted out to reinforce a go-with-your-gut posture around product.
- "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses."
- But a few years back, Harvard Business Review tried to find any evidence at all that Ford ever uttered this statement. And they could not.
- The sentiment of this quote probably would have rung true.
- And it's also worth remember that Ford didn't actually invent the automobile or the assembly line or interchangeable parts.
    - Rather, he's innovation was in figuring out a business model to deliver the automobile to a mass market at a price customers would accept.
- And even though they were able to seize that opportunity, Ford and his company have had to learn (the hard way) how to adapt their business model in face of evolving consumer demands.

# What we *think* innovators look like

> "People don’t know what they want until you show it to them. That’s why I never rely on market research. Our task is to read things that are not yet on the page."

.quote-attribution[Steve Jobs]

???
- Jumping ahead to recent history, the next most obvious example that fits this stereotype of the innovator is Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple.
- His aura still pervades through tech and tech culture, even years after his death.
- As noted by biography Walter Issacson, Jobs would use this quote to silence critics who questioned his vision.
- And the quote we have here is one example of this:
    - "People don’t know what they want until you show it to them. That’s why I never rely on market research. Our task is to read things that are not yet on the page."
- This sentiment is sometimes taken to mean "Don't listen to your customers", which is really not what Jobs meant and isn't at all the way that Apple creates their products.

# What innovation *actually* looks like <br/>aka, The Drunkard's Walk

.center[![Innovation as the Drunkard's walk](drunkards-walk.svg)]

???
- The path to innovation is not straight-forward or obvious even to these mythological figures.
- Rather, the path of innovation is often described as a Drunkard's Walk
- That is, random and unpredictable
- With many possible ideas, new versions of ideas, pivots and emotional states along the way.
- And my purpose here is not to highlight the difference between the ideal model of innovation (linear, smooth and straight) and the reality of innovation (jagged and unpredictable).
- My point is that this is what innovation is supposed to look like
    - not bi-directional, but infinitely directional.
    - having the freedom to explore and experiment.
    - and be creative
- But even as we allow ourselves this freedom, we need some guiding principles.
- Some compass to help orient us and tell us where we're going.
- Something to remind us why we struck out on this path in the first place.
- This brings us to User-Centered Design

# User-Centered Design, a brief overview

### - Sometimes called "Human-Centered Design"
### - Pioneered by Don Norman *The Design of Everyday Things* in the the late 1980s.
### - Technology should be adapted to its users, not the other way around.

???
- Norman was engineer who went on to study psychology (talk about a pivot)
- User-centered design tries to optimize the product around how users can, want, or need to use the product, rather than forcing the users to change their behavior to accommodate the product."

# What do we mean by User-Centered *Design*?

.center[![Decoration does not equal design](design-not-decoration.svg)]

???
- For the uninitiated, design is often thought of in terms of decoration
    - How does it look
    - What color is it
    - How is it arranged
    - What font are using
- Design does include these details, and I don't mean to trivalize them
- But design is about so much more
- Not just how the product looks, but:
    - how does the product works
    - who is the product for
    - what is it's purpose
    - how does it integrate into it's environment
    - how does it make people feel
        - aesthic concerns are part of this, but design is more than that

# What do we mean by User-*Centered* Design?

.center[![Desirability, Feasibility, Viability](d-f-v.svg)]

???
- We mean keeping the concerns about the user in focus at ever decision of the creative process
- I've borrowed this diagram from Matter VC which is an incubator for new media companies
- Last summer, Matter hosted a bootcamp on Design Thinking here at RJI
- These interlocking circles depict the main areas of concern for any new venture:
    - Desirability: Will people want it?
    - Feasibility: Can you build it?
    - Viability: Can you pay for it?
- It's often said we should start any new venture focused on desirability before any other concern.
- Because even if you can build something...what's the point if no one wants it, right?
- I want to be clear that I'm not saying that concerns about desirability should override all other concerns about feasibility or viability.
- But desirability our starting place and also an anchor that we return to.
    - So, for example, when feasibility concerns do arise (..and they will...), we don't just barrel ahead and try to make it anyway.
    - Rather, we figure out we can build whether that new product idea will still be desirable.

# What do we mean by *User*-Centered Design?

### - This is the real meat of the problem: Who are we creating this for?
### - Early stage focus on users, their goals, their tasks, and their environments.
### - Analyze and envision the way users are likely to consume a product
### - But also to validate their assumptions with regard to the user behavior in real world tests.

# User-Centered Design is *empathetic*.

???
- The methods we use are familiar to any journalist

---

class: center, middle

# User-Centered Design is *empirical*.

???
- We have to identify and test our key assumptions about the users and their environment

# User-Centered Design is *iterative*.

???
- A prototype can be any pre-production artifact intended to advance the design concept.
- It advances this design by testing an assumption.
